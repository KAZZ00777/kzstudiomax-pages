    <section id="about">
      <h2>1. About this Policy</h2>
      <p>
        StudyBank – Study Savings – (the “App”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles data, including
        <strong>collection, use, sharing, storage/retention, and your choices</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The operator is <strong>KZ Studio</strong> (“we”, “us”). If you have questions, contact:
        <a href="mailto:kzs0studio@gmail.com">kzs0studio@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="collect">
      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        The App does <strong>not</strong> require account registration, and we do <strong>not</strong> send your study data to our own external servers.
        Study-related data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> (e.g., via <code>UserDefaults</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
        You may optionally enter a <strong>username</strong> for virtual cards, notifications, motivational messages, and “fortune” effects.
        <strong>This username is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>Data stored on your device (not sent to our servers)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Study start/stop times, study duration, and daily totals</li>
        <li>Username displayed on virtual cards (including insertion into messages/notifications)</li>
        <li>App settings (Pomodoro settings, notification schedule/frequency, sound effects, etc.)</li>
        <li>Earnings per session, cumulative totals, and card rank information</li>
        <li>Reward store purchase history and internal flags related to UI/animations</li>
        <li>“Fortune” (virtual fortune) run history/results and multipliers (including timestamps used for daily reset)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Note: Local data is removed from your device if you delete the App or use in-app reset features.
      </p>

      <h3>Collection by Third-Party SDKs (Ads & Analytics)</h3>
      <p>
        The App integrates <strong>Google AdMob (Google LLC)</strong> to deliver ads. AdMob may collect information necessary for ad delivery,
        measurement, frequency capping, fraud prevention, and security.
      </p>
      <p>
        The App also uses <strong>Firebase Analytics (Google LLC)</strong> to understand usage and improve the App. Firebase Analytics may collect
        usage information (for example: app launches, screen views, and interaction/event statistics). This information is used to improve the App.
      </p>

      <h3>Examples of information AdMob may collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Device information, IP address, and information related to ad impressions/clicks</li>
        <li>Consent status required under regional laws (e.g., EEA/UK)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Examples of information Firebase Analytics may collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>App usage (e.g., launches, screen views, interaction events, session information)</li>
        <li>General technical device information (e.g., OS version, device model)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> The App shows <strong>non-personalized ads (NPA)</strong> only.
        The App does <strong>not</strong> use IDFA and does <strong>not</strong> display an
        <strong>App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</strong> permission prompt.
      </p>
